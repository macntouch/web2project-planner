Planner/Dayplanner

This module is intended to give support for planning purposes.
It includes drag and drop support, so some jobs can be done faster than calling webpages and waiting for webpages.
Currently tested on Firefox and Google Chrome, does not work (yet?) on IE.

At the moment, there is are submodules: dayplanner, weekplanner, monthplanner, task planning (interactive gantt).
It intends to help to distribute my current tasks into small workloads that I will tackle in my working day.

Middle display: interactive calendar showing the day's events. Events can be dragged to other time slots, 
or they can be resized. Doubleclick into a time slot creates a new event and stores it to the database (as private event).
Doubleclick on an event changes the color to green. I use this to indicate that I have actually worked on this issue.
So at the end of the day, I can easily see what was not done or at least not started, due to other things coming up.
A tooltip shows info and description for the event.

Company MUST be set to all to display the events, they are not yet attached to a company.

A popup gives links to view/edit the event. Using ctrl or shift/click, this can open in a new window or tab.
Known 'bug': dragging into monthplanner creates the event at midnight, so it will not be shown in day/wekkview.


Left display:
This shows a list of my currently active tasks - colored by overdue, in time, not started yet, 
just as the tasks in the tasks tab are colored.
The tasks can be dragged to a timeslot on the calendar and will be converted into private events and 
stored to the database.
I usually have more tasks than I can finish in a working day - I use this to decide
which tasks I want to work on today at supposedly which time.
After storing (again as private event), they can be resized or dragged to different times.

Tooltips: they allow to view, edit, create task logs, view the parent project, all usng html links.
Holding shift/ckick will open a new browser window for this. Changed info is not yet propagated back to the task display, 
that needs a reload of the page.

Doubleclick on a task will open a dialog for the % progress. 100% is preset, so to finish a task, 
doubleclick enter is sufficient.


In addition to the official company projects in w2p, I created a project for private tasks, another for the small
company tasks that need not be expanded to full fledged projects.

Adding new tasks: typically, I use project designer to add a bunch of these. Usually, I have two or three projectdesigner
windows (for different projects) open to quickly add new tasks when they come up into the appropriate projects, and then pull
them into the day_planner window by a refresh F5.

More to come:

Convert (Thunderbird) emails into w2p tasks.
Interactive change of task start and end date. Like: dragging the events seems to be much faster than using the addedit webpages.
A preview of that is shown in task planner.

etc.


Some bugs, clipped tooltips, etc., but it is usable and helps me to plan since a few weeks, and didn't destroy
anything inside my database (yet?).  No warranty given  in any case.
Don't look at the code, it is a mess.


I tested this on my notebook with a local wampserver. Response times are fine, for display and also for posting to the database.

Beware: creating new events, the title is stored as is - I didn't check yet whether w2p checks elsewhere for bad html, sql
injection etc. I don't do that on my server, but this potential safety flaw makes the module still beta.

Nevertheless, for me, it is usable. Enjoy.
